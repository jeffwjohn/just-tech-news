{{!-- Did you notice the {{ }} expressions that can be used for content (e.g., {{vote_count}} point(s)), as well as for attributes in HTML elements (e.g., <a href="{{post_url}}">)? When the template is rendered and sent to the client, the expressions will be replaced by the correct data. 
    
The main.handlebars file used three curly brackets as {{{ body }}}, but here we're only using two brackets as {{ title }}. Why is that? The difference is that two brackets will convert HTML characters to strings. For instance, < would become &lt;. Three brackets, on the other hand, will render the data as HTML.--}}
